6 x LEDs (Whote)
1 x 10uF Capacitor 
1 x MG995 Servo Motor (180°)
1 x Arduino NANO (or UNO)
1 x Slide switch ( 2 positions)

For power up the helmet we have 2 options...

Option 1: 
2 x 9VDC batteries

Option 2:
3 x TP4056 (Lithium Battery Charging Board)
3 x 3.7 VDC lithium rechargeable battery (  between 1000 - 2000 mAh)
1 x MT3608 (DC-DC Step Up Converter Booster Power Supply)

Recommendations
- Test everything on a Breadboard before installing on the helmet
- You will need some wires and jumpers for wiring
- For the LiPo batteries you must connect them in series to increase the voltage and maintain the current for the Servo
- It is important to protect every LiPo battery wit a TP4056 board, as they can get damaged if we don't have this protection
- Go for a curstom PCB board if you have any around
